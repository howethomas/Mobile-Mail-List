h1. Mobile Mail List

The Mobile Mail List is a combined Rails 2.2 and Voxeo Tropo application designed to allow retail establishments a method of 
collecting cell phone numbers from customers in order to track purchases, send them mobile coupons, etc.  The application is
written in Ruby, and the voice script is written in a DSL called "Tropo":http://www.tropo.com  Tropo is really cool 
because you can write one script and it can handle voice, SMS and IM interactions using the same dialog.

For instance, the heart of this application's script is very simple:


  answer

  wait 1000

  caller_id = $currentCall.callerID

  log "Accepting a call from #{caller_id}"

  say "Thanks for calling #{COMPANY_NAME} #{SLOGAN}.  We will enter your mobile phone in our database, and you are now eligible to receive a discount off of our products \
      and to receive periodic coupons to your cell phone for special deals."

  if is_phone(caller_id)
    result = ask "Are you calling from the mobile phone you want to register? You must be able to receive text messages to redeem coupons.", yes_no_options
    if result.name == "choice" and result.value == "no" then
      caller_id = nil
    end
  end
  
  until is_phone(caller_id)
    log "Asking for a valid phone number."
    result=ask 'Please enter the 10 digit U.S. phone number you would like to register.', phone_number_options 
    log result.inspect

    caller_id = result.value
  end

  log "Adding #{caller_id} to the mobile mail list."
  res = Net::HTTP.post_form(URI.parse('http://mobilemaillist.heroku.com/subscribers.xml'), {"subscriber[site_id]" => SITE_ID.to_s, "subscriber[callerid]" => caller_id})

  say "Thanks for signing up for our preferred customer program. You will receive exclusive savings offers to your mobile \
    phone, and receive ten percent off all future purchases. Thanks for shopping at #{COMPANY_NAME}. Good bye!"

Bort is a base Rails 2.2 application that makes creating new projects easier and faster. Bort is developed and maintained by "Fudge Studios":http://www.fudgestudios.com, "Jim Neath":http://jimneath.org and "Matt Hall":http://matthall.wordpress.com

If you have any suggestions for improvements then feel free to leave a request on "User Voice":http://bort.uservoice.com

h2. Install

* Download and unzip Bort
* Edit the database.yml and the settings.yml files
* Changed the default password in the bort migration
* Edit the REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY in each of the environment files
* Rake db:migrate
* Have a brew and celebrate

h2. Plugins Installed

Bort comes with a few commonly used plugins installed and already setup.

h3. RESTful Authentication

RESTful Authentication is already setup. The routes are setup, along with the mailers and observers.
Forgotten password comes setup, so you don't have to mess around setting it up with every project.

The AASM plugin comes pre-installed. RESTful Authentication is also setup to use user activation.

h3. User Roles

Bort now comes with "Role Requirement":http://code.google.com/p/rolerequirement/ by Tim Harper. A default 
admin role is predefined along with a default admin user. See the migrations for the admin login details.

h3. Open ID Authentication

Bort, as of 0.3, has Open ID integrated with RESTful Authentication. Rejoice!

h3. Will Paginate

We use will_paginate in pretty much every project we use, so Bort comes with it pre-installed.

h3. Rspec & Rspec-rails

You should be testing your code, so Bort comes with Rspec and Rspec-rails already installed so you're
ready to roll.

h3. Exception Notifier

You don't want your applications to crash and burn so Exception Notifier is already installed to let 
you know when everything goes to shit.

h3. Asset Packager

Packages up your css/javascript so you're not sending 143 files down to the user at the same time. Reduces
load times and saves you bandwidth.

h2. Routes

The routes for RESful Auth and the forgot password stuff are already sorted for you.

h2. Settings YAML

There is a settings.yml file that contains site-wide stuff. The site name, url and admin email are all used
in the RESTful Auth mailers, so you don't need to worry about editing them.

h2. Database YAML

The database.yml defaults to sqlite3 but also contains the settings for MySQL in comments so you can switch
over easily.

h2. Capistrano Recipe

Bort comes ready to rock capistrano. The recipe that is setup is based on using git and passenger. It's ready
to go with multistage deployments. It deploys to the production config by default, so if you don't need it
you can ignore it. Just update config/deploy/production.rb with your deployment settings.

More info on capistrano-ext/multistage deployments can be found here: http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2007/7/23/capistrano-multistage

h2. Uses the Database for Sessions

Bort is setup to use the database to store sessions by default.
